measure and compare song switch rate for solo versus countersinging and near vs far
measure song overlap based on moment-to-moment distance rather than median distance between birds
statistical comparison of results based on acoustic frame of reference
analyzing or estimating song output on the unanalyzed recordings to remove bias from song output disparity
time series analyses / regression between distance and consistency, overlap, and freq matching.
time series analyses / regression between birds for consistency, overlap, and freq matching.
analysis of birds across the various countersinging measures (ie did birds tend to be significant in multiple ways?)
null markov models for syntax to measure conventional matching
chi-square tests for pivot tables of conventionl matching between near and far.
chi-square tests for pivot tables of individual syntax between near and far.
